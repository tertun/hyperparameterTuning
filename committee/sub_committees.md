# Sub Committees

## Overview 

LAS sub committees are established by the Management Board for a specific purpose, and have a membership structure in line with that purpose.

LAS sub committees are self organising, and operate with executive power within the remit given to them by the Management Board. 

All sub committees answer to the Management Board and the LAS Membership it represents. Sub committees will escalate any issue to the Management Board where sub committee activities:

- require funding or resources from LAS, or;
- are deemed controversial enough to need a referendum of LAS Members

LAS sub committees should ideally be no more than 7 persons in size. The purpose of the sub committee may determine the make-up of its members. However, any limitations on membership will only be applied in the interest of furthering the committee's purpose.

## Roles & Responsibilities

The members of each sub committee will elect a Chair and Secretary from within their ranks.

The Chair will run meetings according to the "standing orders"; that is an agreed format for the sub committee meeting. Standing orders should include as a minimum:

- roll call; who is in attendance
- approve the minutes from the last meeting
- run through the prepared agenda
- agree a time for the next meeting
- ensure committee activities are sanctioned by the Management Board

The Secretary prepares for the meeting and assists the Chair in his role.

- Prepare meeting agendas in consultation with the Chair
- Notify members of meetings (date, time, venue)
- Write up the minutes; detailing resolutions and actions

## Getting the culture right

What tends to get in the way of effective management is the committee becomes a "gab fest" and individual committee members fail to follow through on agreed actions. This can be very demoralising for everyone involved.

To counter this tendency, it's important to create a conscious culture of "getting things done". 

Some basic ground rules for any committee include:

1. Committee members are expected to fulfil their roles between meetings; the purpose of the meetings is to check on progress.
2. Committee members have full authority to take all necessary actions to fulfil their allocated responsibilities within their portfolio and allotted budgets (if any).
3. All briefing papers will be read before the meeting, not at the meeting.
4. Each committee member shares collective responsibility and ownership of agreed decisions, irrespective of their personal view or vote on the matter.
