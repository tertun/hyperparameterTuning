# Membership

Members must fall within one of the following classes; individual, corporate or honorary.

## Membership Classes

> Articles; 4. Membership
> Members can become natural or legal persons to support the purpose of the association.

### Corporate

A corporate entity can be a Member of LAS.  A corporate entity has a single vote. 

A corporate entity may have several different representatives acting in a voluntary capacity on behalf of LAS. However, the Member only ever has a single vote with respect to binding decisions made by the Management Board or it's sub-committees regardless of the number of contributing representatives.

$599USD per calendar month

### Individual

An individual member is a legal person as opposed to a corporate entity. Individual membership has equivalent rights to Corporate membership, and incurs the same fees as Corporate Membership.

$599USD per calendar month

### Honorary

An honorary membership is an honorific bestowed upon an individual or corporate entity in recognition for significant contributions to the LAS objectives.

An honorary membership has no specific rights beyond the use of the title. For example, they have no voting rights.

$0 per calendar month; lifetime award

## Membership Admissions

> Articles; 4. Membership
> The management and the general meeting can determine the admission of new members.

> Articles; 4. Membership
> Requests for admission are to be directed to the management board; the management board determines the admission.

Persons or Corporates wishing to become members can approach the Management Board for consideration. A majority vote of the Management Board can see a new member admitted under either Individual or Corporate membership.

Alternatively, a vote on the admission of a new member can be raised by an existing Member at the General Assembly (GA). Nominations for new members need to be made during the formation of the GA Agenda, and distributed to existing Members ahead of the GA as part of the Agenda.

_Note; the articles are out of order, but this may simply be a translation issue._

> Articles; 4. Membership
> The management can grant the honorary membership to any member furthering the company's interests.

Honorary Members are always voted on by all Members at a full General Assembly.

_Note; this proposal is in conflict with the existing Articles._

## Membership Dues

> Articles; 4. Membership
> The membership fees are yearly determined by the general meeting. Honorary members and acting management board members are qualified for exemption of fees.

Membership Dues are paid monthly in arrears.

Members must be "financial" (ie. be up to date with their membership dues). Failure to be "financial" can render a Members vote invalid and may result in expulsion.

Contra deals for services are not acceptable forms of payment for membership dues. If a Member is providing paid services to LAS that are recognised by the Management Board, remuneration will be made separately from the LAS accounts.

_Note; with respect to fee exemptions, there is no specific mechanism for defining how and when dues might be exempted. The Articles imply that any Member who serves on the Management Board could be exempted dues. However, having the Management Board determine whether or not it pays dues will not sit well with a wider membership._
