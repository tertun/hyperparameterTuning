# Management Board Elections

**Proposed Management Board regulation**

Members are responsible for electing representatives of the executive leadership team (Chairman, Treasurer, and Secretary) and non-executive Management Committee representatives.

_GB: what should be the practical upper limit of the number of people on the Management Board? Currently the Articles allow for a Board of any size if the Membership choose to vote that way._

## Eligibility

Only a financial Member is eligible for election to the Management Committee. In the case of Corporate Members, only a single representative is eligible to act on behalf of the Corporate Member.

_Note; we may need to allow additional representatives to be present in an advisory (ie non-voting) capacity._

## Elections

All elections should be part of the Annual General Assembly.  This minimises the number of communications with voting Members.  By-elections would still result in the event of an unexpected resignation, if it was outside of 3 months of the next Annual General Assembly.

The management committee is empowered to appoint a temporary acting role for periods of less than three months.

## Executive Roles

_GB: Management board roles are voted by the management board itself. the only member election requirements are the President and the Management Board members themselves. Probably worthwhile considering President and Chairman as separate roles._

For executive roles (Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary) elections are determined by a clear majority bewteen two candidates.  

In the case of more than two candidates, a primary election process will be used to determine two candidates for the election. Members will have an open primary ballot for all candidates. The two candidates with the most votes in the open primary ballot progress to the general election. Note, a winner is never chosen in the primary, even if one candidate has over 50% of the primary vote.

All ties are resolved by the selection of a random ballot.

_GB: while i like this election process, the current Articles suggest that only a majority vote of members is required for election. While the Articles are not explicit and open to interpretation, it may be appropriate to update the articles to nominate a specific voting process for elections._

## Non-Executive Appointments

Non executive roles â€” TBD

_Note, we really need to understand if there are a fixed number of non-executive members, and what the makeup of the management board should be beyond the executive._


## Appointment Period

All elected Members of the Management Board are appointed for the period up until the next Annual General Assembly.  That is a maximum of a one year term before re-election.

## Term Limits

There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a duly re-elected Member (or representative) can serve.
