# Vice President

The Vice-President assists the President in whatever capacity the President needs.  In an operational sense, the Vice President is responsible for acting as the President in the Presidents absence.

_GB: The Vice President role varies from place to place.  Sometimes it's a not even a specific role in its own right; for example, the Secretary might fulfil this role for a short absence or the Management Board might elect an "acting President" in the event of a more extended absence._
