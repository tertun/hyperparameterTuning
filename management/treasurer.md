## Advice for Treasurer

As a matter of urgency, any newly appointed Treasurer would:

- Check details of all bank accounts and all signatories
- Swap signatories straight away. Get the forms from the bank and take them to the annual meeting
- Check details of credit card or spending authorisations and organise for the return of outstanding chequebooks or cards
- Check who has the financial files and get all documents and budget information, including special events budgets and details of purchases
- Detail any spending commitments or incomings not included in budget papers
- Prepare a timeline of upcoming payments and dates when bills (insurance/rent/whatever) are due

_Note it would be typical for all payments or authorisations for recurring payments to require two signatories._

_Note many associations/societies have the following three signatories; treasurer, chairman, vice-chairman._
