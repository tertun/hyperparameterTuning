# President

The President is the leader but not the "boss". The key task of President is to ensure that the needs and wishes of the Membership are given a voice and that LAS fulfils its charter to further the Lucee Server.

## Responsibilities

- Chair LAS Management Committee (in consultation with the Secretary); ensure that all matters are discussed and the best decisions made, without lengthy meetings
- Remain informed of all LAS activities: for example, know the current financial position, each of the programs run by LAS, who is in charge of them and their status
- Be aware of the future directions and plans of LAS
- Have a good working knowledge of the Articles, LAS rules and duties of office bearers and committees
- Represent LAS; for example, at conferences or other public functions
- Facilitate LAS activities: encourage and motivate Members to ensure that planned activities go ahead
- Ensure LAS activities are sanctioned by the executive committee
- Work with the treasurer to ensure financial accountability

## Advice for President

- Lead without controlling

- Stimulate balanced discussion
- Time meetings to finish on time
- Encourage focused discussion and keep meetings on track
- Negotiate successfully between members and LISTEN
